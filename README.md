# Egg Hunt
## Objective
**Egg hunt** is a little game where you control a basket, 
and you have to catch *chocolate eggs* which fall from the sky.

## Things I could possibly add on later versions
* Make a half rect for the basket object
* Sounds and music(s)
* Create a menu with some buttons
* Create a pause menu
* Make multiple eggs falling at the same time
